Netflix earnings : New subscribers are still the most important thing for investors
Analysts agree with CEO Reed Hastings that the second quarter is typically a weak one for subscriber additions
When it comes to Netflix Inc. , investors have traditionally set their sights on the ebb and flow of the company 's subscriber numbers .
Subscribers are , after all , the streaming giant 's main source of revenue .
Everything Netflix does is to serve that subscriber base and attract new subscribers .
But the second quarter is a historically weak one for Netflix subscriber additions .
Last year Netflix shares were pummeled immediately after the company 's second-quarter release , in which it reported adding 1.7 million subscribers , below Wall Street expectations of 2.5 million net adds .
While that quarter 's subscriber numbers were impacted by users ditching the service following price increases , Chief Executive Reed Hastings noted during the company 's quarterly earnings call that the second quarter is , `` generally a seasonally tight quarter for us . ''
UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson , who has a buy rating on Netflix with a $ 175 12-month price target , said that despite management protests , subscriber additions are still the most important metric .
And he noted that seasonal churn should be a small headwind .
`` The Street and UBS has held relatively tight to guidance this quarter , '' Mitchelson wrote of subscriber estimates .
He expects 2.6 million subscriber adds in the second quarter , `` due to a very strong original content slate and easy churn comparisons .
`` We expect Netflix 's original content ramp to continue to drive accelerating international net additions , especially as Netflix increases investment in local content overseas and expands genres such as movies and non-fiction . ''
Netflix has shown it is willing to spend whatever it takes to give viewers what they want , and even what they do n't yet know they want .
As Netflix 's subscriber numbers have increased , so have its overall content spending obligations , which include amounts related to content acquisition and licensing and other agreements .
The company had 98 million subscribers at the end of the first quarter , up from 46 million at the end of the first quarter of 2014 .
In the same time frame , its total streaming content obligations have increased to $ 15.29 billion from $ 8.86 billion , according to regulatory filings .
However , Netflix seems to be getting smarter about the amount of cash it shells out per show versus the number of viewers a show actually attracts .
Over the course of May and June , Netflix canceled three of its original series -- after canceling just five since 2012 .
The company axed `` The Get Down , '' `` Sense8 '' and `` Girlboss . ''
MarketWatch has reported `` The Get Down '' was one of TV 's most expensive shows , costing Netflix $ 120 million , or about $ 11 million per episode .
And reports have pinned `` Sense8 '' at about $ 9 million an episode .
Netflix keeps viewership on its platform close to the vest , but none of the three canceled shows appear to have garnered the same level of engagement as Netflix hits , such as `` Stranger Things , '' `` House of Cards , '' `` Orange is the New Black '' and even `` Master of None , '' shows that the company often praises .
Netflix will report its earnings for the second quarter after the market closes on Monday .
