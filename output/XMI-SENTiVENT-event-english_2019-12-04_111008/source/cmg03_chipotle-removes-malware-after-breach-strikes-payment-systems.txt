Chipotle Removes Malware After Breach Strikes Payment Systems
- Chipotle had warned customers about hacker attack last month
- Incident comes as Chipotle tries to bounce back from crisis
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. , which warned investors and customers last month that it had suffered a data breach , gave the all-clear on Friday , saying it had removed malicious software from its systems .
The company identified the so-called malware during a probe that included law enforcement , payment-card networks and cybersecurity firms , the burrito chain said .
Hackers installed the software in order to grab customer data from point-of-sale devices , striking between March 24 and April 18 .
`` The malware searched for track data which sometimes has cardholder name in addition to card number , expiration date and internal verification code read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through the POS device , '' Chipotle said in a statement .
`` There is no indication that other customer information was affected . ''
The data breach was the latest setback for a company that has struggled to revive growth .
An E. coli scare in late 2015 sent its sales and stock price plunging .
To win back customers , the Denver-based chain has rolled out a new ad campaign and free-food offers .
The company also shook up its board after being targeted by activist investor Bill Ackman .
Same-store sales began to recover last quarter after declining for five straight periods , raising hope that a turnaround is underway .
On Friday , Chipotle warned customers to check their credit-card statements for unauthorized charges and `` remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud . ''
