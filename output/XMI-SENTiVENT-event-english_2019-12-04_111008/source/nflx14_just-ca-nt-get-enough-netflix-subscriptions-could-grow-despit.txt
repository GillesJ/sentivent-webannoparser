Just Ca n't Get Enough : Netflix Subscriptions Could Grow Despite Price Hike
Netflix ( NFLX ) may have raised subscription prices this month , but consumers evidently ca n't get enough of it .
An analysis of Google search terms by Piper Jaffray on Wednesday suggests an uptick in domestic and international subscriptions for Netflix in its fiscal fourth quarter .
Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said he is `` modeling 9.3 % y/y domestic sub growth in Q4 and our search index points to 14.8 % growth .
For int ` l , we are modeling 38.7 % y/y sub growth ( consensus is 38.9 % ) and our index points to 54.5 % growth . ''
He quickly added , however , that both growth rates suggested are preliminary , and only for the first two months of Q4 .
The video-streaming service added 5.3 million paid subscribers ( 850,000 in the U.S. ) in its fiscal third quarter , raising its total to 109.3 million globally .
That drove Netflix to nearly $ 3 billion in Q3 revenue .
In a September report , Piper Jaffray predicted Netflix would reach 160 million subscribers in three years .
Continued growth in Netflix subscriptions would significantly bolster revenue , since the company in December raised its monthly subscription prices for standard U.S. subscribers ( $ 9.99 to $ 10.99 ) and premier tier users ( $ 11.99 to $ 13.99 ) .
The basic $ 7.99 plan is unchanged .
